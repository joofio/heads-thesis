	volume = {6},

	doi = {10.1371/journal.pone.0028071},
	abstract = {Background: Privacy legislation in most jurisdictions allows the disclosure of health data for secondary purposes without patient consent if it is de-identified. Some recent articles in the medical, legal, and computer science literature have argued that de-identification methods do not provide sufficient protection because they are easy to reverse. Should this be the case, it would have significant and important implications on how health information is disclosed, including: (a) potentially limiting its availability for secondary purposes such as research, and (b) resulting in more identifiable health information being disclosed. Our objectives in this systematic review were to: (a) characterize known re-identification attacks on health data and contrast that to re-identification attacks on other kinds of data, (b) compute the overall proportion of records that have been correctly re-identified in these attacks, and (c) assess whether these demonstrate weaknesses in current de-identification methods. Methods and Findings: Searches were conducted in IEEE Xplore, ACM Digital Library, and PubMed. After screening, fourteen eligible articles representing distinct attacks were identified. On average, approximately a quarter of the records were re-identified across all studies (0.26 with 95\% CI 0.046-0.478) and 0.34 for attacks on health data (95\% CI 0-0.744). There was considerable uncertainty around the proportions as evidenced by the wide confidence intervals, and the mean proportion of records re-identified was sensitive to unpublished studies. Two of fourteen attacks were performed with data that was de-identified using existing standards. Only one of these attacks was on health data, which resulted in a success rate of 0.00013. Conclusions: The current evidence shows a high re-identification rate but is dominated by small-scale studies on data that was not de-identified according to existing standards. This evidence is insufficient to draw conclusions about the efficacy of de-identification methods. © 2011 El Emam et al.},

In this situation, it is a good alternative to use synthetic data. The objective of this research is to generate realistic synthetic data so that people can use it freely. We propose a synthetic data generation model based on boundary-seeking generative adversarial networks (BGANs)-designated as medical BGAN or medBGAN and compare its performances with an existing method medical GAN (medGAN). We aim to perform the investigation on several datasets in two different domains: electronic health records (EHRs) in the medical domain and a crime dataset in the City of Los Angeles Police Department. Firstly, we train the models and generate synthetic data by using these trained models. We then analyze and compare the models' performance by applying some statistical methods (dimension-wise average and Kolmogorov-Smirnov test) and two machine learning tasks (association rule mining and prediction). The comprehensive analysis of this study shows that the proposed model is more effective in generating realistic synthetic data than those generated using medGAN.},

	abstract = {Access to electronic health record (EHR) data has motivated computational advances in medical research. However, various concerns, particularly over privacy, can limit access to and collaborative use of EHR data. Sharing synthetic EHR data could mitigate risk. In this paper, we propose a new approach, medical Generative Adversarial Network (medGAN), to generate realistic synthetic patient records. Based on input real patient records, medGAN can generate high-dimensional discrete variables (e.g., binary and count features) via a combination of an autoencoder and generative adversarial networks. We also propose minibatch averaging to efficiently avoid mode collapse, and increase the learning efficiency with batch normalization and shortcut connections. To demonstrate feasibility, we showed that medGAN generates synthetic patient records that achieve comparable performance to real data on many experiments including distribution statistics, predictive modeling tasks and a medical expert review. We also empirically observe a limited privacy risk in both identity and attribute disclosure using medGAN.},

The training procedure for G is to maximize the probability of D making a mistake. This framework corresponds to a minimax two-player game. In the space of arbitrary functions G and D, a unique solution exists, with G recovering the training data distribution and D equal to 1/2 everywhere. In the case where G and D are defined by multilayer perceptrons, the entire system can be trained with backpropagation. There is no need for any Markov chains or unrolled approximate inference networks during either training or generation of samples. Experiments demonstrate the potential of the framework through qualitative and quantitative evaluation of the generated samples.},

We expand on previous work for image quality assessment to provide two new analyses for assessing the discriminability and diversity of samples from class-conditional image synthesis models. These analyses demonstrate that high resolution samples provide class information not present in low resolution samples. Across 1000 ImageNet classes, 128 x 128 samples are more than twice as discriminable as artificially resized 32 x 32 samples. In addition, 84.7\% of the classes have samples exhibiting diversity comparable to real Image Net data.},

	abstract = {Privacy is an important concern for our society where sharing data with partners or releasing data to the public is a frequent occurrence. Some of the techniques that are being used to achieve privacy are to remove identifiers, alter quasi-identifiers, and perturb values. Unfortunately, these approaches suffer from two limitations. First, it has been shown that private information can still be leaked if attackers possess some background knowledge or other information sources. Second, they do not take into account the adverse impact these methods will have on the utility of the released data. In this paper, we propose a method that meets both requirements. Our method, called table-GAN, uses generative adversarial networks (GANs) to synthesize fake tables that are statistically similar to the original table yet do not incur information leakage. We show that the machine learning models trained using our synthetic tables exhibit performance that is similar to that of models trained using the original table for unknown testing cases. We call this property model compatibility. We believe that anonymization/perturbation/synthesis methods without model compatibility are of little value. We used four real-world datasets from four different domains for our experiments and conducted indepth comparisons with state-of-the-art anonymization, perturbation, and generation techniques. Throughout our experiments, only our method consistently shows balance between privacy level and model compatibility.},

	abstract = {Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) and its variants have recently attracted intensive research interests due to their elegant theoretical foundation and excellent empirical performance as generative models. These tools provide a promising direction in the studies where data availability is limited. One common issue in GANs is that the density of the learned generative distribution could concentrate on the training data points, meaning that they can easily remember training samples due to the high model complexity of deep networks. This becomes a major concern when GANs are applied to private or sensitive data such as patient medical records, and the concentration of distribution may divulge critical patient information. To address this issue, in this paper we propose a differentially private GAN (DPGAN) model, in which we achieve differential privacy in GANs by adding carefully designed noise to gradients during the learning procedure. We provide rigorous proof for the privacy guarantee, as well as comprehensive empirical evidence to support our analysis, where we demonstrate that our method can generate high quality data points at a reasonable privacy level.},

In this paper, we investigate a method for ensuring (differential) privacy of the generator of the Generative Adversarial Nets (GAN) framework. The resulting model can be used for generating synthetic data on which algorithms can be trained and validated, and on which competitions can be conducted, without compromising the privacy of the original dataset. Our method modifies the Private Aggregation of Teacher Ensembles (PATE) framework and applies it to GANs. Our modified framework (which we call PATE-GAN) allows us to tightly bound the influence of any individual sample on the model, resulting in tight differential privacy guarantees and thus an improved performance over models with the same guarantees. We also look at measuring the quality of synthetic data from a new angle; we assert that for the synthetic data to be useful for machine learning researchers, the relative performance of two algorithms (trained and tested) on the synthetic dataset should be the same as their relative performance (when trained and tested) on the original dataset. Our experiments, on various datasets, demonstrate that PATE-GAN consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art method with respect to this and other notions of synthetic data quality.},

To aid in a fair and thorough comparison, we design a benchmark with 7 simulated and 8 real datasets and several Bayesian network baselines.

In this paper, we propose a novel framework called correlation-capturing Generative Adversarial Network (CorGAN), to generate synthetic healthcare records. In CorGAN we utilize Convolutional Neural Networks to capture the correlations between adjacent medical features in the data representation space by combining Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks and Convolutional Autoencoders. To demonstrate the model fidelity, we show that CorGAN generates synthetic data with performance similar to that of real data in various Machine Learning settings such as classification and prediction. We also give a privacy assessment and report on statistical analysis regarding realistic characteristics of the synthetic data.

However, progress is slow. Legal and ethical issues around unconsented patient data and privacy is one of the limiting factors in data sharing, resulting in a significant barrier in accessing routinely collected electronic health records (EHR) by the machine learning community. We propose a novel framework for generating synthetic data that closely approximates the joint distribution of variables in an original EHR dataset, providing a readily accessible, legally and ethically appropriate solution to support more open data sharing, enabling the development of AI solutions. In order to address issues around lack of clarity in defining sufficient anonymization, we created a quantifiable, mathematical definition for ``identifiability\{''\}. We used a conditional generative adversarial networks (GAN) framework to generate synthetic data while minimize patient identifiability that is defined based on the probability of re-identification given the combination of all data on any individual patient. We compared models fitted to our synthetically generated data to those fitted to the real data across four independent datasets to evaluate similarity in model performance, while assessing the extent to which original observations can be identified from the synthetic data. Our model, ADS-GAN, consistently outperformed state-of-the-art methods, and demonstrated reliability in the joint distributions. We propose that this method could be used to develop datasets that can be made publicly available while considerably lowering the risk of breaching patient confidentiality.},

	abstract = {Objective: The aim of this study was to generate synthetic electronic health records (EHRs). The generated EHR data will be more realistic than those generated using the existing medical Generative Adversarial Network (medGAN) method. Materials and Methods: We modified medGAN to obtain two synthetic data generation models-designated as medicalWasserstein GAN with gradient penalty (medWGAN) and medical boundary-seeking GAN (medBGAN)-and compared the results obtained using the three models. We used 2 databases: MIMIC-III and National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD), Taiwan. First, we trained the models and generated synthetic EHRs by using these three 3 models. We then analyzed and compared the models' performance by using a few statistical methods (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, dimension-wise probability for binary data, and dimension-wise average count for count data) and 2 machine learning tasks (association rule mining and prediction). Results: We conducted a comprehensive analysis and found our models were adequately efficient for generating synthetic EHR data. The proposed models outperformed medGAN in all cases, and among the 3 models, boundary-seeking GAN (medBGAN) performed the best. Discussion: To generate realistic synthetic EHR data, the proposed models will be effective in the medical industry and related research from the viewpoint of providing better services. Moreover, they will eliminate barriers including limited access to EHR data and thus accelerate research on medical informatics. Conclusion: The proposed models can adequately learn the data distribution of real EHRs and efficiently generate realistic synthetic EHRs. The results show the superiority of our models over the existing model.},

	abstract = {Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) and its variants serve as a perfect representation of the data generation model, providing researchers with a large amount of high-quality generated data. They illustrate a promising direction for research with limited data availability. When GAN learns the semantic-rich data distribution from a dataset, the density of the generated distribution tends to concentrate on the training data. Due to the gradient parameters of the deep neural network contain the data distribution of the training samples, they can easily remember the training samples. When GAN is applied to private or sensitive data, for instance, patient medical records, as private information may be leakage. To address this issue, we propose a Privacy-preserving Generative Adversarial Network (PPGAN) model, in which we achieve differential privacy in GANs by adding well-designed noise to the gradient during the model learning procedure. Besides, we introduced the Moments Accountant strategy in the PPGAN training process to improve the stability and compatibility of the model by controlling privacy loss. We also give a mathematical proof of the differential privacy discriminator. Through extensive case studies of the benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that PPGAN can generate high-quality synthetic data while retaining the required data available under a reasonable privacy budget.},

In healthcare, synthetic data generation can be helpful for producing annotated data and improving data-driven research without worries on data privacy. However, electronic health records (EHRs) are noisy, incomplete and complex, and existing work on EHR data is mainly devoted to generating discrete elements such as diagnosis codes and medications or frequent laboratory values. In this work, we propose SMOOTH-GAN, a novel approach for generating reliable EHR data such as laboratory values and medications given diagnosis codes. SMOOTH-GAN takes advantage of a conditional GAN architecture with WGAN-GP loss, and is able to learn transitions between disease stages with high flexibility over data customization. Our experiments demonstrate the model’s effectiveness in terms of both statistical similarity and accuracy on machine learning based prediction. To further demonstrate the usage of our model, we apply counterfactual reasoning and generate data with occurrence of multiple diseases, which can provide unique datasets for artificial intelligence driven healthcare research.},

In this paper, we revisit several representative sample-based evaluation metrics for GANs, and address the problem of how to evaluate the evaluation metrics. We start with a few necessary conditions for metrics to produce meaningful scores, such as distinguishing real from generated samples, identifying mode dropping and mode collapsing, and detecting overfitting. With a series of carefully designed experiments, we comprehensively investigate existing sample-based metrics and identify their strengths and limitations in practical settings. Based on these results, we observe that kernel Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) and the 1-Nearest-Neighbor (1-NN) two-sample test seem to satisfy most of the desirable properties, provided that the distances between samples are computed in a suitable feature space. Our experiments also unveil interesting properties about the behavior of several popular GAN models, such as whether they are memorizing training samples, and how far they are from learning the target distribution.},

	abstract = {Background: Machine learning (ML) has made a significant impact in medicine and cancer research; however, its impact in these areas has been undeniably slower and more limited than in other application domains. A major reason for this has been the lack of availability of patient data to the broader ML research community, in large part due to patient privacy protection concerns. High-quality, realistic, synthetic datasets can be leveraged to accelerate methodological developments in medicine. By and large, medical data is high dimensional and often categorical. These characteristics pose multiple modeling challenges. Methods: In this paper, we evaluate three classes of synthetic data generation approaches; probabilistic models, classification-based imputation models, and generative adversarial neural networks. Metrics for evaluating the quality of the generated synthetic datasets are presented and discussed. Results: While the results and discussions are broadly applicable to medical data, for demonstration purposes we generate synthetic datasets for cancer based on the publicly available cancer registry data from the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) program. Specifically, our cohort consists of breast, respiratory, and non-solid cancer cases diagnosed between 2010 and 2015, which includes over 360,000 individual cases. Conclusions: We discuss the trade-offs of the different methods and metrics, providing guidance on considerations for the generation and usage of medical synthetic data.},

In particular, the pharmaceutical industry is starting to realise the value of synthetic data which is being utilised more prevalently as a method to optimise data utility and sharing, ultimately as an innovative response to the growing demand for improved privacy. Synthetic data is data generated by simulation, based upon and mirroring properties of an original dataset. Here, with supporting viewpoints from across the pharmaceutical industry, we set out to explore use cases for synthetic data across seven key but relatable areas for optimising data utility for improved data privacy and protection. We also discuss the various methods which can be used to produce a synthetic dataset and availability of metrics to ensure robust quality of generated synthetic datasets. Lastly, we discuss the potential merits, challenges and future direction of synthetic data within the pharmaceutical industry and the considerations for this privacy enhancing technology.},

	abstract = {Synthetic datasets produced by generative models are advertised as a silver-bullet solution to privacy-preserving data sharing. Claims about the privacy benefits of synthetic data, however, have not been supported by a rigorous privacy analysis. In this paper, we introduce an evaluation framework that enables data holders to (I) quantify the privacy gain of publishing a synthetic dataset instead of the raw data, and (II) compare the privacy properties of generative model training algorithms. We illustrate the utility of the framework and quantify privacy gain with respect to two concerns, the risk of re-identification via linkage and the risk of attribute disclosure, on synthetic data produced by a range of generative models, from simple independent histograms to differentially private GANs. We find that, across the board, synthetic data provides little privacy gain even under a black-box adversary with access to a single synthetic dataset only. Moreover, we observe that some target records receive substantially less protection than others and that the more complex the generative model, the more difficult it is to predict which targets will remain vulnerable to privacy attacks. Our findings highlight the need to re-consider whether synthetic data is an appropriate strategy to privacy-preserving data publishing.},

We are able to sample from the model and create synthetic data, hence the name {SDV}. When implementing the {SDV}, we also developed an algorithm that computes statistics at the intersection of related database tables. We then used a stateof-the-art multivariate modeling approach to model this data. The {SDV} iterates through all possible relations, ultimately creating a model for the entire database. Once this model is computed, the same relational information allows the {SDV} to synthesize data by sampling from any part of the database.},

METHODS: Survey of trends in this work, and exploration of literature describing how large-scale structured and unstructured data sources are being used to support applications from clinical decision making and health policy, to drug design and pharmacovigilance, and further to systems biology and genetics. RESULTS: The survey highlights ongoing development of powerful new methods for turning that large-scale, and often complex, data into information that provides new insights into human health, in a range of different areas. Consideration of this body of work identifies several important paradigm shifts that are facilitated by Big Data resources and methods: in clinical and translational research, from hypothesis-driven research to data-driven research, and in medicine, from evidence-based practice to practice-based evidence. CONCLUSIONS: The increasing scale and availability of large quantities of health data require strategies for data management, data linkage, and data integration beyond the limits of many existing information systems, and substantial effort is underway to meet those needs. As our ability to make sense of that data improves, the value of the data will continue to increase. Health systems, genetics and genomics, population and public health; all areas of biomedicine stand to benefit from Big Data and the associated technologies.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Poor clinical data quality might affect clinical decision making and patient treatment. This study identifies quality defects in clinical data collected automatically by bedside monitoring devices in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and examines their effect on clinical decisions. METHODS: Real-world data collected from 7688 patients admitted to the general ICU in a tertiary referral hospital over seven years was retrospectively analyzed. Data quality defect detection methods that use time-series analysis techniques identified two types of data quality defects: (a) completeness: the extent of non-missing values, and (b) validity: the extent of non-extreme values within the continuous range of values. Data quality defects were compared to five scenarios of medication and procedure prescriptions that are common in ICU settings: Blood-pressure reduction, blood-pressure elevation, anesthesia medications, intubation procedures, and muscle relaxant medications. RESULTS: Results from a logistic regression revealed a strong connection between data quality and the clinical interventions examined: lower validity level increased the likelihood of prescription decisions for all five scenarios, and lower completeness level increased the likelihood of prescription decisions for some scenarios. DISCUSSION: The results highlight the possible effect of data quality defects on physicians' decisions. Lower validity of certain key clinical parameters, and in some scenarios lower completeness, correlated with stronger tendency to prescribe medications or perform invasive procedures. CONCLUSIONS: Data quality defects in clinical data affect decision making even without practitioners' awareness. Thus, it is important to emphasize these effects to ICU staff, as well as to medical device manufacturers.},

In this study, we assess the impact of the entire data audit process on subsequent statistical analyses. METHODS: We conducted on-site audits of datasets from nine international HIV care sites. Error rates were quantified for key demographic and clinical variables among a subset of records randomly selected for auditing. Based on audit results, some sites were tasked with targeted validation of high-error-rate variables resulting in a post-audit dataset. We estimated the times from antiretroviral therapy initiation until death and first AIDS-defining event using the pre-audit data, the audit data, and the post-audit data. RESULTS: The overall discrepancy rate between pre-audit and audit data (n\,=\,250) across all audited variables was 17.1\%. The estimated probability of mortality and an AIDS-defining event over time was higher in the audited data relative to the pre-audit data. Among patients represented in both the post-audit and pre-audit cohorts (n\,=\,18,999), AIDS and mortality estimates also were higher in the post-audit data. CONCLUSION: Though some changes may have occurred independently, our findings suggest that improved data quality following the audit may impact epidemiological inferences.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The proliferation and use of electronic medical records (EMR) in the clinical setting now provide a rich source of clinical data that can be leveraged to support research on patient outcomes, comparative effectiveness, and health systems research. Once the large volume and variety of data that robust clinical EMRs provide is aggregated, the suitability of the data for research purposes must be addressed. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is two-fold. First, we present a stepwise framework capable of guiding initial data quality assessment when matching multiple data sources regardless of context or application. Then, we demonstrate a use case of initial analysis of a longitudinal data repository of electronic health record data that illustrates the first four steps of the framework, and report results. METHODS: A six-step data quality assessment framework is proposed and described that includes the following data quality assessment steps: (1) preliminary analysis, (2) documentation-longitudinal concordance, (3) breadth, (4) data element presence, (5) density, and (6) prediction. The six-step framework was applied to the Transport Data Mart-a data repository that contains over 28,000 records for patients that underwent interhospital transfer that includes EMRs from the sending hospitalization, transport, and receiving hospitalization. RESULTS: There were a total of 9557 log entries of which 8139 were successfully matched to corresponding hospital encounters. 2832 were successfully mapped to both the sending and receiving hospital encounters (resulting in a 93\% automatic matching rate), with 590 including air medical transport EMR data representing a complete case for testing. Results from Step 2 indicate that once records are identified and matched, there appears to be relatively limited drop-off of additional records when the criteria for matching increases, indicating the a proportion of records consistently contain nearly complete data. Measures of central tendency used in Step 3 and 4 exhibit a right skewness suggesting that a small proportion of records contain the highest number of repeated measures for the measured variables. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed six-step data quality assessment framework is useful in establishing the metadata for a longitudinal data repository that can be replicated by other studies. There are practical issues that need to be addressed including the data quality assessments-with the most prescient being the need to establish data quality metrics for benchmarking acceptable levels of EMR data inclusiveness through testing and application.},

  abstract = {Background {$\quad$}The implementation of an electronic health record (EHR) with structured and standardized recording of patient data can improve data quality and reusability. Whether and how users perceive these advantages may depend on the preimplementation situation. ,  Objective {$\quad$}To determine whether the influence of implementing a structured and standardized EHR on perceived EHR use, data quality, and data reuse differed for users working with paper-based records versus a legacy EHR before implementation. ,  Methods {$\quad$}We used an electronic questionnaire to measure users' perception before implementation (2014), expected change, and perceived change after implementation (2016) on three themes. We included all health care professionals in two university hospitals in the Netherlands. Before jointly implementing the same structured and standardized EHR, one hospital used paper-based records and the other a legacy EHR. We compared perceptions before and after implementation for both centers. Additionally, we compared expected benefit with perceived benefit. ,  Results {$\quad$}We received 7,611 responses (4,537 before and 3,074 after implementation) of which 5,707 (75\%) were from professionals reading and recording patient data. A total of 975 (13\%) professionals responded to both before and after implementation questionnaires. In the formerly paper-based center staff perceived improvement in all themes after implementation. The legacy EHR center experienced deterioration of perceived EHR use and data reuse, and only one improvement in EHR use. In both centers, for half of the aspects at least 45\% of responders experienced results worse than expected preimplementation. ,  Conclusion {$\quad$}Our results indicate that the preimplementation recording practice impacts the perceived effect of the implementation of a structured and standardized EHR. For almost half of the respondents the new EHR did not meet their expectations. Especially legacy EHR centers need to investigate the expectations as these might be different and less clear cut than those in paper-based centers. These expectations need to be addressed appropriately to achieve a successful implementation.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Data quality and fitness for analysis are crucial if outputs of analyses of electronic health record data or administrative claims data should be trusted by the public and the research community. METHODS: We describe a data quality analysis tool (called Achilles Heel) developed by the Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics Collaborative (OHDSI) and compare outputs from this tool as it was applied to 24 large healthcare datasets across seven different organizations. RESULTS: We highlight 12 data quality rules that identified issues in at least 10 of the 24 datasets and provide a full set of 71 rules identified in at least one dataset. Achilles Heel is a freely available software that provides a useful starter set of data quality rules with the ability to add additional rules. We also present results of a structured email-based interview of all participating sites that collected qualitative comments about the value of Achilles Heel for data quality evaluation. DISCUSSION: Our analysis represents the first comparison of outputs from a data quality tool that implements a fixed (but extensible) set of data quality rules. Thanks to a common data model, we were able to compare quickly multiple datasets originating from several countries in America, Europe and Asia.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Development of systematic approaches for understanding and assessing data quality is becoming increasingly important as the volume and utilization of health data steadily increases. In this study, a taxonomy of data defects was developed and utilized when automatically detecting defects to assess Medicaid data quality maintained by one of the states in the United States. MATERIALS AND METHODS: There were more than 2.23 million rows and 32 million cells in the Medicaid data examined. The taxonomy was developed through document review, descriptive data analysis, and literature review. A software program was created to automatically detect defects by using a set of constraints whose development was facilitated by the taxonomy. RESULTS: Five major categories and seventeen subcategories of defects were identified. The major categories are missingness, incorrectness, syntax violation, semantic violation, and duplicity. More than 3 million defects were detected indicating substantial problems with data quality. Defect density exceeded 10\% in five tables. The majority of the data defects belonged to format mismatch, invalid code, dependency-contract violation, and implausible value types. Such contextual knowledge can support prioritized quality improvement initiatives for the Medicaid data studied. CONCLUSIONS: This research took the initial steps to understand the types of data defects and detect defects in large healthcare datasets. The results generally suggest that healthcare organizations can potentially benefit from focusing on data quality improvement. For those purposes, the taxonomy developed and the approach followed in this study can be adopted.},

  abstract = {Objective: Harmonized data quality (DQ) assessment terms, methods, and reporting practices can establish a common understanding of the strengths and limitations of electronic health record (EHR) data for operational analytics, quality improvement, and research. Existing published DQ terms were harmonized to a comprehensive unified terminology with definitions and examples and organized into a conceptual framework to support a common approach to defining whether EHR data is `fit' for specific uses. Materials and Methods: DQ publications, informatics and analytics experts, managers of established DQ programs, and operational manuals from several mature EHR-based research networks were reviewed to identify potential DQ terms and categories. Two face-to-face stakeholder meetings were used to vet an initial set of DQ terms and definitions that were grouped into an overall conceptual framework. Feedback received from data producers and users was used to construct a draft set of harmonized DQ terms and categories. Multiple rounds of iterative refinement resulted in a set of terms and organizing framework consisting of DQ categories, subcategories, terms, definitions, and examples. The harmonized terminology and logical framework's inclusiveness was evaluated against ten published DQ terminologies. Results: Existing DQ terms were harmonized and organized into a framework by defining three DQ categories: (1) Conformance (2) Completeness and (3) Plausibility and two DQ assessment contexts: (1) Verification and (2) Validation. Conformance and Plausibility categories were further divided into subcategories. Each category and subcategory was defined with respect to whether the data may be verified with organizational data, or validated against an accepted gold standard, depending on proposed context and uses. The coverage of the harmonized DQ terminology was validated by successfully aligning to multiple published DQ terminologies. Discussion: Existing DQ concepts, community input, and expert review informed the development of a distinct set of terms, organized into categories and subcategories. The resulting DQ terms successfully encompassed a wide range of disparate DQ terminologies. Operational definitions were developed to provide guidance for implementing DQ assessment procedures. The resulting structure is an inclusive DQ framework for standardizing DQ assessment and reporting. While our analysis focused on the DQ issues often found in EHR data, the new terminology may be applicable to a wide range of electronic health data such as administrative, research, and patient-reported data. Conclusion: A consistent, common DQ terminology, organized into a logical framework, is an initial step in enabling data owners and users, patients, and policy makers to evaluate and communicate data quality findings in a well-defined manner with a shared vocabulary. Future work will leverage the framework and terminology to develop reusable data quality assessment and reporting methods.},

Using an iterative process, the aspects of data quality being measured were abstracted and categorized, as well as the methods of assessment used.Results Five dimensions of data quality were identified, which are completeness, correctness, concordance, plausibility, and currency, and seven broad categories of data quality assessment methods: comparison with gold standards, data element agreement, data source agreement, distribution comparison, validity checks, log review, and element presence.Discussion Examination of the methods by which clinical researchers have investigated the quality and suitability of EHR data for research shows that there are fundamental features of data quality, which may be difficult to measure, as well as proxy dimensions. Researchers interested in the reuse of EHR data for clinical research are recommended to consider the adoption of a consistent taxonomy of EHR data quality, to remain aware of the task-dependence of data quality, to integrate work on data quality assessment from other fields, and to adopt systematic, empirically driven, statistically based methods of data quality assessment.Conclusion There is currently little consistency or potential generalizability in the methods used to assess EHR data quality. If the reuse of EHR data for clinical research is to become accepted, researchers should adopt validated, systematic methods of EHR data quality assessment.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To synthesize data quality (DQ) dimensions and assessment methods of real-world data, especially electronic health records, through a systematic scoping review and to assess the practice of DQ assessment in the national Patient-centered Clinical Research Network (PCORnet). MATERIALS AND METHODS: We started with 3 widely cited DQ literature-2 reviews from Chan et al (2010) and Weiskopf et al (2013a) and 1 DQ framework from Kahn et al (2016)-and expanded our review systematically to cover relevant articles published up to February 2020. We extracted DQ dimensions and assessment methods from these studies, mapped their relationships, and organized a synthesized summarization of existing DQ dimensions and assessment methods. We reviewed the data checks employed by the PCORnet and mapped them to the synthesized DQ dimensions and methods. RESULTS: We analyzed a total of 3 reviews, 20 DQ frameworks, and 226 DQ studies and extracted 14 DQ dimensions and 10 assessment methods. We found that completeness, concordance, and correctness/accuracy were commonly assessed. Element presence, validity check, and conformance were commonly used DQ assessment methods and were the main focuses of the PCORnet data checks. DISCUSSION: Definitions of DQ dimensions and methods were not consistent in the literature, and the DQ assessment practice was not evenly distributed (eg, usability and ease-of-use were rarely discussed). Challenges in DQ assessments, given the complex and heterogeneous nature of real-world data, exist. CONCLUSION: The practice of DQ assessment is still limited in scope. Future work is warranted to generate understandable, executable, and reusable DQ measures.},

  abstract = {Background Caesarean section (CS) rates continue to evoke worldwide concern because of their steady increase, lack of consensus on the appropriate CS rate and the associated additional short- and long-term risks and costs. We present the latest CS rates and trends over the last 24 years. Methods We collected nationally-representative data on CS rates between 1990 to 2014 and calculated regional and subregional weighted averages. We conducted a longitudinal analysis calculating differences in CS rates as absolute change and as the average annual rate of increase (AARI). Results According to the latest data from 150 countries, currently 18.6\% of all births occur by CS, ranging from 6\% to 27.2\% in the least and most developed regions, respectively. Latin America and the Caribbean region has the highest CS rates (40.5\%), followed by Northern America (32.3\%), Oceania (31.1\%), Europe (25\%), Asia (19.2\%) and Africa (7.3\%). Based on the data from 121 countries, the trend analysis showed that between 1990 and 2014, the global average CS rate increased 12.4\% (from 6.7\% to 19.1\%) with an average annual rate of increase of 4.4\%. The largest absolute increases occurred in Latin America and the Caribbean (19.4\%, from 22.8\% to 42.2\%), followed by Asia (15.1\%, from 4.4\% to 19.5\%), Oceania (14.1\%, from 18.5\% to 32.6\%), Europe (13.8\%, from 11.2\% to 25\%), Northern America (10\%, from 22.3\% to 32.3\%) and Africa (4.5\%, from 2.9\% to 7.4\%). Asia and Northern America were the regions with the highest and lowest average annual rate of increase (6.4\% and 1.6\%, respectively). Conclusion The use of CS worldwide has increased to unprecedented levels although the gap between higher- and lower-resource settings remains. The information presented is essential to inform policy and global and regional strategies aimed at optimizing the use of CS.},

  abstract = {Non‐clinical interventions for reducing unnecessary caesarean section         ,            What is the aim of this review?         , The aim of this Cochrane Review was to find out whether non‐clinical interventions, which aim to reduce unnecessary caesarean sections, such as providing education to healthcare workers and mothers, are safe and effective. This review was first published in 2011. This review update will inform a new WHO guideline, and the scope of the update was informed by WHO’s Guideline Development Group for this guideline.,            Key messages         , We studied a wide range of non‐clinical interventions that aim to reduce unnecessary caesarean sections, mostly in high‐income countries. Based on high‐quality evidence, few interventions have been shown to reduce caesarean section rates without adverse effects on maternal or neonatal outcomes. These interventions are mainly aimed at healthcare professionals (nurses, midwives, physicians) and involve using: clinical guidelines combined with mandatory second opinion for caesarean section indication; clinical guidelines combined with audit and feedback about caesarean section practices; and opinion leaders (obstetrician/gynaecologist) to provide education to healthcare professionals.,            What was studied in this review?         , Caesarean section is an operation used to prevent and reduce complications of childbirth. While it can be a life‐saving procedure for both the mother and baby, caesarean section is not without harm and should only be carried out when necessary. Caesarean sections increase the likelihood of bleeding, maternal infections and infant breathing problems, among other complications. The number of caesarean sections performed has been increasing worldwide. Whilst there may be medical reasons for this increase, other factors, such as clinician convenience and maternal fears, may also be responsible.,            What are the main results of the review?         , We included 29 studies in this review. Most of the studies (20 studies) were conducted in high‐income countries; none in low‐income countries., We rated the quality of the evidence from studies using four levels: very low, low, moderate, or high. Very low‐quality means that we are very uncertain about the results. High‐quality evidence means that we are very confident in the results., Overall, we found eight of the 29 interventions included in the review to have a beneficial effect on at least one of our main outcomes with low‐, moderate‐ or high‐quality evidence, and no moderate‐ or high‐quality evidence of harm:, Interventions aimed at women or families: providing childbirth training workshops for mothers and couples; relaxation training programmes led by nurses; psychosocial couple‐based prevention programmes; and psychoeducation. The interventions were compared to routine practice. The quality of evidence from the studies was low., Interventions aimed at healthcare professionals: using clinical guidelines combined with mandatory second opinion for caesarean section indication; using clinical guidelines combined with audit and feedback about caesarean section practices; and having opinion leaders (obstetrician/gynaecologist) provide education to healthcare professionals. The interventions were compared to routine practice. The quality of evidence was high., Interventions aimed at healthcare organisations or facilities: collaborative midwifery‐labourist model of care (in which the obstetrician provides in‐house labour and delivery coverage, 24 hours a day, without competing clinical duties) compared to a private model of care. The quality of evidence was low., We studied a number of other interventions and they either made little or no difference to caesarean section rates, or had uncertain effects., Limited data were available on possible harms associated with the interventions examined in this review.,            How up‐to‐date is this review?         , The evidence is current to March 2018.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To estimate the incidence of multiple repeat caesarean section (MRCS) (five or more) in the UK and to describe the outcomes for women and their babies relative to women having fewer repeat caesarean sections. DESIGN: A national population-based prospective cohort study using the UK Obstetric Surveillance System (UKOSS). SETTING: All UK hospitals with consultant-led maternity units. POPULATION: Ninety-four women having their fifth or greater MRCS between January 2009 and December 2009, and 175 comparison women having their second to fourth caesarean section. METHODS: Prospective cohort and comparison identification through the UKOSS monthly mailing system. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Incidence, maternal and neonatal complications. Relative risk, unadjusted (OR) and adjusted (aOR) odds ratio estimates. RESULTS: The estimated UK incidence of MRCS was 1.20 per 10 000 maternities [95\% confidence interval (CI), 0.97-1.47]. Women with MRCS had significantly more major obstetric haemorrhages ({$>$}1500 ml) (aOR, 18.6; 95\% CI, 3.89-88.8), visceral damage (aOR, 17.6; 95\% CI, 1.85-167.1) and critical care admissions (aOR, 15.5; 95\% CI, 3.16-76.0), than women with lower order repeat caesarean sections. These risks were greatest in the 18\% of women with MRCS who also had placenta praevia or accreta. Neonates of mothers having MRCS were significantly more likely to be born prior to 37 weeks of gestation (OR, 6.15; 95\% CI, 2.56-15.78) and therefore had higher rates of complications and admissions. CONCLUSIONS: MRCS is associated with greater maternal and neonatal morbidity than fewer caesarean sections. The associated maternal morbidity is largely secondary to placenta praevia and accreta, whereas higher rates of preterm delivery are most likely a response to antepartum haemorrhage.},

This study was performed for the 2010 National Institutes of Health Consensus Development Conference on Vaginal Birth After Cesarean: New Insights. STUDY DESIGN: We conducted a systematic review and metaanalysis of observational studies. RESULTS: Twenty-one studies (2,282,922 deliveries) were included. The rate of hysterectomy, blood transfusions, adhesions, and surgical injury all increased with increasing number of cesarean deliveries. The incidence of placenta previa increased from 10/1000 deliveries with 1 previous cesarean delivery to 28/1000 with ≥3 cesarean deliveries. Compared with women with previa and no previous cesarean delivery, women with previa and ≥3 cesarean deliveries had a statistically significant increased risk of accreta (3.3-4\% vs 50-67\%), hysterectomy (0.7-4\% vs 50-67\%), and composite maternal morbidity (15\% vs 83\%; odds ratio, 33.6; 95\% confidence interval, 14.6-77.4). CONCLUSION: Serious maternal morbidity progressively increased as the number of previous cesarean deliveries increased.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cesarean birth rates continue to rise worldwide with recent (2016) reported rates of 24.5\% in Western Europe, 32\% in North America, and 41\% in South America. The objective of this systematic review is to describe the long-term risks and benefits of cesarean delivery for mother, baby, and subsequent pregnancies. The primary maternal outcome was pelvic floor dysfunction, the primary baby outcome was asthma, and the primary subsequent pregnancy outcome was perinatal death. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Medline, Embase, Cochrane, and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) databases were systematically searched for published studies in human subjects (last search 25 May 2017), supplemented by manual searches. Included studies were randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and large (more than 1,000 participants) prospective cohort studies with greater than or equal to one-year follow-up comparing outcomes of women delivering by cesarean delivery and by vaginal delivery. Two assessors screened 30,327 abstracts. Studies were graded for risk of bias by two assessors using the Scottish Intercollegiate Guideline Network (SIGN) Methodology Checklist and the Risk of Bias Assessment tool for Non-Randomized Studies. Results were pooled in fixed effects meta-analyses or in random effects models when significant heterogeneity was present (I2 ≥ 40\%). One RCT and 79 cohort studies (all from high income countries) were included, involving 29,928,274 participants. Compared to vaginal delivery, cesarean delivery was associated with decreased risk of urinary incontinence, odds ratio (OR) 0.56 (95\% CI 0.47 to 0.66; n = 58,900; 8 studies) and pelvic organ prolapse (OR 0.29, 0.17 to 0.51; n = 39,208; 2 studies). Children delivered by cesarean delivery had increased risk of asthma up to the age of 12 years (OR 1.21, 1.11 to 1.32; n = 887,960; 13 studies) and obesity up to the age of 5 years (OR 1.59, 1.33 to 1.90; n = 64,113; 6 studies). Pregnancy after cesarean delivery was associated with increased risk of miscarriage (OR 1.17, 1.03 to 1.32; n = 151,412; 4 studies) and stillbirth (OR 1.27, 1.15 to 1.40; n = 703,562; 8 studies), but not perinatal mortality (OR 1.11, 0.89 to 1.39; n = 91,429; 2 studies). Pregnancy following cesarean delivery was associated with increased risk of placenta previa (OR 1.74, 1.62 to 1.87; n = 7,101,692; 10 studies), placenta accreta (OR 2.95, 1.32 to 6.60; n = 705,108; 3 studies), and placental abruption (OR 1.38, 1.27 to 1.49; n = 5,667,160; 6 studies). This is a comprehensive review adhering to a registered protocol, and guidelines for the Meta-analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology were followed, but it is based on predominantly observational data, and in some meta-analyses, between-study heterogeneity is high; therefore, causation cannot be inferred and the results should be interpreted with caution. CONCLUSIONS: When compared with vaginal delivery, cesarean delivery is associated with a reduced rate of urinary incontinence and pelvic organ prolapse, but this should be weighed against the association with increased risks for fertility, future pregnancy, and long-term childhood outcomes. This information could be valuable in counselling women on mode of delivery.},

The review resulted in several conclusions: (1) the diagnosis of placenta accreta and cesarean scar pregnancy is difficult; (2) transvaginal ultrasound seems to be the best diagnostic tool to establish the diagnosis; (3) an early and correct diagnosis may prevent some of their complications; (4) curettage and systemic methotrexate therapy and embolization as single treatments should be avoided if possible; and (5) in the case of cesarean scar pregnancy, local methotrexate- and hysteroscopic-directed procedures had the lowest complication rates.},

Correlation analysis was performed using Pearson correlation coefficient to select the most relevant predictors. We used APGAR score as a metrics for the childbirth outcomes. Score of 5 and less was considered as a negative outcome. To analyze the influence of the unstructured anamnesis data on the prediction accuracy we have run two prediction experiments for every classification task: 1. Without unstructured data and 2. With unstructured data. This study presents implementation of predictive models for adverse childbirth events that provides higher precision than state of the art models. This is due to the use of unstructured medical data in addition to the structured dataset that allowed to reach 0.92 precision.

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Predicting a woman's probability of vaginal birth after cesarean could facilitate the antenatal decision-making process. Having a previous vaginal birth strongly predicts vaginal birth after cesarean. Delivery outcome in women with only a cesarean delivery is more unpredictable. Therefore, to better predict vaginal birth in women with only one prior cesarean delivery and no vaginal deliveries would greatly benefit clinical practice and fill a key evidence gap in research. Our aim was to predict vaginal birth in women with one prior cesarean and no vaginal deliveries using machine-learning methods, and compare with a US prediction model and its further developed model for a Swedish setting. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A population-based cohort study with a cohort of 3116 women with only one prior birth, a cesarean, and a subsequent trial of labor during 2008-2014 in the Stockholm-Gotland region, Sweden. Three machine-learning methods (conditional inference tree, conditional random forest and lasso binary regression) were used to predict vaginal birth after cesarean among women with one previous birth. Performance of the new models was compared with two existing models developed by Grobman et al (USA) and Fagerberg et al (Sweden). Our main outcome measures were area under the receiver-operating curve (AUROC), overall accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of prediction of vaginal birth after previous cesarean delivery. RESULTS: The AUROC ranged from 0.61 to 0.69 for all models, sensitivity was above 91\% and specificity below 22\%. The majority of women with an unplanned repeat cesarean had a predicted probability of vaginal birth after cesarean {$>$}60\%. CONCLUSIONS: Both classical regression models and machine-learning models had a high sensitivity in predicting vaginal birth after cesarean in women without a previous vaginal delivery. The majority of women with an unplanned repeat cesarean delivery were predicted to succeed with a vaginal birth (ie specificity was low). Additional covariates combined with machine-learning techniques did not outperform classical regression models in this study.},

{METHODS}: All women with one prior low transverse cesarean who underwent a trial of labor at term with a vertex singleton gestation were identified from a concurrently collected database of deliveries at 19 academic centers during a 4-year period. Using factors identifiable at the first prenatal visit, we analyzed different classification techniques in an effort to develop a meaningful prediction model for {VBAC} success. After development and cross-validation, this model was represented by a graphic nomogram.
{RESULTS}: Seven-thousand six hundred sixty women were available for analysis. The prediction model is based on a multivariable logistic regression, including the variables of maternal age, body mass index, ethnicity, prior vaginal delivery, the occurrence of a {VBAC}, and a potentially recurrent indication for the cesarean delivery. After analyzing the model with cross-validation techniques, it was found to be both accurate and discriminating.
{CONCLUSION}: A predictive nomogram, which incorporates six variables easily ascertainable at the first prenatal visit, has been developed that allows the determination of a patient-specific chance for successful {VBAC} for those women who undertake trial of labor.

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: The use of artificial intelligence has revolutionized every area of life such as business and trade, social and electronic media, education and learning, manufacturing industries, medicine and sciences, and every other sector. The new reforms and advanced technologies of artificial intelligence have enabled data analysts to transmute raw data generated by these sectors into meaningful insights for an effective decision-making process. Health care is one of the integral sectors where a large amount of data is generated daily, and making effective decisions based on these data is therefore a challenge. In this study, cases related to childbirth either by the traditional method of vaginal delivery or cesarean delivery were investigated. Cesarean delivery is performed to save both the mother and the fetus when complications related to vaginal birth arise.
{OBJECTIVE}: The aim of this study was to develop reliable prediction models for a maternity care decision support system to predict the mode of delivery before childbirth.
{METHODS}: This study was conducted in 2 parts for identifying the mode of childbirth: first, the existing data set was enriched and second, previous medical records about the mode of delivery were investigated using machine learning algorithms and by extracting meaningful insights from unseen cases. Several prediction models were trained to achieve this objective, such as decision tree, random forest, {AdaBoostM}1, bagging, and k-nearest neighbor, based on original and enriched data sets.
{RESULTS}: The prediction models based on enriched data performed well in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, F-measure, and receiver operating characteristic curves in the outcomes. Specifically, the accuracy of k-nearest neighbor was 84.38\%, that of bagging was 83.75\%, that of random forest was 83.13\%, that of decision tree was 81.25\%, and that of {AdaBoostM}1 was 80.63\%. Enrichment of the data set had a good impact on improving the accuracy of the prediction process, which supports maternity care practitioners in making decisions in critical cases.
{CONCLUSIONS}: Our study shows that enriching the data set improves the accuracy of the prediction process, thereby supporting maternity care practitioners in making informed decisions in critical cases. The enriched data set used in this study yields good results, but this data set can become even better if the records are increased with real clinical data.},

	abstract = {Objective To establish a case-adjusted hospital-specific performance evaluation tool using machine learning methodology for cesarean delivery. Data Sources Secondary data were collected from patients between January 1, 2015 and February 28, 2018 using a hospital's “Electronic Data Warehouse” database from Illinois, {USA}. Study Design The machine learning methodology of optimal classification trees ({OCTs}) was used to predict cesarean delivery rate by physician group, thereby establishing the case-adjusted benchmarking standards in comparison to the overall hospital cesarean delivery rate. Outcomes of specific patient populations of each participating practice were predicted, as if each were treated in the overall hospital environment. The resulting {OCTs} estimate physician group expected cesarean delivery outcomes, both aggregate and in specific clinical situations. Data Collection/Extraction Methods Twelve thousand eight hunderd and forty one singleton, vertex, term deliveries, cared for by practices with ≥50 births. Principal Findings The overall rate of cesarean delivery was 18.6\% (n = 2384), with a range of 13.3\%–33.7\% amongst 22 physician practices. An optimal decision tree was used to create a prediction model for the hospital overall, which defined 23 patient cohorts divided by 46 nodes. The model's performance for prediction of cesarean delivery is as follows: area under the curve 0.73, sensitivity 98.4\%, specificity 16.1\%, positive predictive value 83.7\%, negative predictive value 70.6\%. Comparisons with the overall hospital's specific-case adjusted benchmark groups revealed that several groups outperformed the overall hospital benchmark, and some practice groups underperformed in comparison to the overall hospital benchmark. Conclusions {OCT} benchmarking can assess physician practice-specific case-adjusted performance, both overall and clinical situation-specific, and can serve as a valuable tool for hospital self-assessment and quality improvement.},

	abstract = {Background:  Visual inspection of cardiotocography traces by obstetricians and mid‑wives is the gold standard for monitoring the wellbeing of the foetus during antenatal care. However, inter- and intra-observer variability is high with only a 30\% positive predictive value for the classification of pathological outcomes. This has a significant negative impact on the perinatal foetus and often results in cardio-pulmonary arrest, brain and vital organ damage, cerebral palsy, hearing, visual and cognitive defects and in severe cases, death. This paper shows that using machine learning and foetal heart rate signals provides direct information about the foetal state and helps to filter the subjective opinions of medical practitioners when used as a decision support tool. The primary aim is to provide a proof-of-concept that demonstrates how machine learning can be used to objectively determine when medical intervention, such as caesarean section, is required and help avoid preventable perinatal deaths.
Methods:  This is evidenced using an open dataset that comprises 506 controls (nor‑mal virginal deliveries) and 46 cases (caesarean due to {pH} ≤ 7.20—acidosis, n = 18; {pH} {\textgreater} 7.20 and {pH} {\textless} 7.25—foetal deterioration, n = 4; or clinical decision without evidence of pathological outcome measures, n = 24). Several machine-learning algo‑rithms are trained, and validated, using binary classifier performance measures.
Results:  The findings show that deep learning classification achieves sensitiv‑ity = 94\%, specificity = 91\%, Area under the curve = 99\%, F-score = 100\%, and mean square error = 1\%.
Conclusions:  The results demonstrate that machine learning significantly improves the efficiency for the detection of caesarean section and normal vaginal deliveries using foetal heart rate signals compared with obstetrician and midwife predictions and systems reported in previous studies.},

	abstract = {We propose objective and robust measures for the purpose of classiﬁcation of “vaginal vs. cesarean section” delivery by investigating temporal dynamics and complex interactions between fetal heart rate ({FHR}) and maternal uterine contraction ({UC}) recordings from cardiotocographic ({CTG}) traces. Multivariate extension of empirical mode decomposition ({EMD}) yields intrinsic scales embedded in {UC}-{FHR} recordings while also retaining inter-channel ({UC}-{FHR}) coupling at multiple scales. The mode alignment property of {EMD} results in the matched signal decomposition, in terms of frequency content, which paves the way for the selection of robust and objective time-frequency features for the problem at hand. Speciﬁcally, instantaneous amplitude and instantaneous frequency of multivariate intrinsic mode functions are utilized to construct a class of features which capture nonlinear and nonstationary interactions from {UC}-{FHR} recordings. The proposed features are fed to a variety of modern machine learning classiﬁers (decision tree, support vector machine, {AdaBoost}) to delineate vaginal and cesarean dynamics. We evaluate the performance of different classiﬁers on a real world dataset by investigating the following classifying measures: sensitivity, speciﬁcity, area under the {ROC} curve ({AUC}) and mean squared error ({MSE}). It is observed that under the application of all proposed 40 features {AdaBoost} classiﬁer provides the best accuracy of 91.8\% sensitivity, 95.5\% speciﬁcity, 98\% {AUC}, and 5\% {MSE}. To conclude, the utilization of all proposed time-frequency features as input to machine learning classiﬁers can beneﬁt clinical obstetric practitioners through a robust and automatic approach for the classiﬁcation of fetus dynamics.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.ajog.2019.12.267},
	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Efforts to reduce cesarean delivery rates to 12-15\% have been undertaken worldwide. Special focus has been directed towards parturients who undergo a trial of labor after cesarean delivery to reduce the burden of repeated cesarean deliveries. Complication rates are lowest when a vaginal birth is achieved and highest when an unplanned cesarean delivery is performed, which emphasizes the need to assess, in advance, the likelihood of a successful vaginal birth after cesarean delivery. Vaginal birth after cesarean delivery calculators have been developed in different populations; however, some limitations to their implementation into clinical practice have been described. Machine-learning methods enable investigation of large-scale datasets with input combinations that traditional statistical analysis tools have difficulty processing.
{OBJECTIVE}: The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of using machine-learning methods to predict a successful vaginal birth after cesarean delivery.
{STUDY} {DESIGN}: The electronic medical records of singleton, term labors during a 12-year period in a tertiary referral center were analyzed. With the use of gradient boosting, models that incorporated multiple maternal and fetal features were created to predict successful vaginal birth in parturients who undergo a trial of labor after cesarean delivery. One model was created to provide a personalized risk score for vaginal birth after cesarean delivery with the use of features that are available as early as the first antenatal visit; a second model was created that reassesses this score after features are added that are available only in proximity to delivery.
{RESULTS}: A cohort of 9888 parturients with 1 previous cesarean delivery was identified, of which 75.6\% of parturients (n=7473) attempted a trial of labor, with a success rate of 88\%. A machine-learning-based model to predict when vaginal delivery would be successful was developed. When features that are available at the first antenatal visit are used, the model showed a receiver operating characteristic curve with area under the curve of 0.745 (95\% confidence interval, 0.728-0.762) that increased to 0.793 (95\% confidence interval, 0.778-0.808) when features that are available in proximity to the delivery process were added. Additionally, for the later model, a risk stratification tool was built to allocate parturients into low-, medium-, and high-risk groups for failed trial of labor after cesarean delivery. The low- and medium-risk groups (42.4\% and 25.6\% of parturients, respectively) showed a success rate of 97.3\% and 90.9\%, respectively. The high-risk group (32.1\%) had a vaginal delivery success rate of 73.3\%. Application of the model to a cohort of parturients who elected a repeat cesarean delivery (n=2145) demonstrated that 31\% of these parturients would have been allocated to the low- and medium-risk groups had a trial of labor been attempted.
{CONCLUSION}: Trial of labor after cesarean delivery is safe for most parturients. Success rates are high, even in a population with high rates of trial of labor after cesarean delivery. Application of a machine-learning algorithm to assign a personalized risk score for a successful vaginal birth after cesarean delivery may help in decision-making and contribute to a reduction in cesarean delivery rates. Parturient allocation to risk groups may help delivery process management.},

	abstract = {We aimed to investigate bias in applying machine learning to predict real-world individual treatment effects. Materials and Methods: Using a virtual patient cohort, we simulated real-world healthcare data and applied random forest and gradient boosting classifiers to develop prediction models. Treatment effect was estimated as the difference between the predicted outcomes of a treatment and a control. We evaluated the impact of predictors (ie, treatment predictors [X1], confounders [X2], treatment effects modifiers [X3], and other outcome risk factors [X4]) with known effects on treatment and outcome using real-world data, and outcome imbalance on predicting individual outcome. Using counterfactuals, we evaluated percentage of patients with biased predicted individual treatment effects Results: The X4 had relatively more impact on model performance than X2 and X3 did. No effects were observed from X1. Moderate-to-severe outcome imbalance had a significantly negative impact on model performance, particularly among subgroups in which an outcome occurred. Bias in predicting individual treatment effects was significant and persisted even when the models had a 100\% accuracy in predicting health outcome. Discussion: Inadequate inclusion of the X2, X3, and X4 and moderate-to-severe outcome imbalance may affect model performance in predicting individual outcome and subsequently bias in predicting individual treatment effects. Machine learning models with all features and high performance for predicting individual outcome still yielded biased individual treatment effects. Conclusions: Direct application of machine learning might not adequately address bias in predicting individual treatment effects. Further method development is needed to advance machine learning to support individualized treatment selection.},

The field of personalized medicine stands to benefit from new technologies so as to harness the omics big data, for example, to individualize and accelerate cancer diagnostics and therapeutics in particular. In this overarching context, breast cancer is one of the most common malignancies worldwide with multiple underlying molecular etiologies and each subtype displaying diverse clinical outcomes. Disease stratification for breast cancer is, therefore, vital to its effective and individualized clinical care. The support vector machine (SVM) is a rising machine learning approach that offers robust classification of high-dimensional big data into small numbers of data points (support vectors), achieving differentiation of subgroups in a short amount of time. Considering the rapid timelines required for both diagnosis and treatment of most aggressive cancers, this new machine learning technique has important clinical and public applications and implications for high-throughput data analysis and contextualization. This expert review describes and examines, first, the SVM models employed to forecast breast cancer subtypes using diverse systems science data, including transcriptomics, epigenetics, proteomics, and radiomics, as well as biological pathway, clinical, pathological, and biochemical data. Then, we compare the performance of the present SVM and other diagnostic and therapeutic prediction models across the data types. We conclude by emphasizing that data integration is a critical bottleneck in systems science, cancer research and development, and health care innovation and that SVM and machine learning approaches offer new solutions and ways forward in biomedical, bioengineering, and clinical applications.},

Machine learning is both an expanding and an evolving computational field that holds promise to cover such needs. Here we provide a focused overview of: 1) the various supervised and unsupervised algorithms used specifically in drug response prediction applications, 2) the strategies employed to develop these algorithms into applicable models, 3) data resources that are fed into these frameworks and 4) pitfalls and challenges to maximize model performance. In this context we also describe a novel in silico screening process, based on Association Rule Mining, for identifying genes as candidate drivers of drug response and compare it with relevant data mining frameworks, for which we generated a web application freely available at: https://compbio.nyumc.org/drugs/. This pipeline explores with high efficiency large sample-spaces, while is able to detect low frequency events and evaluate statistical significance even in the multidimensional space, presenting the results in the form of easily interpretable rules.

This paper provides an overview of the research progress in the application of learning methods, with a focus on deep learning in personalized medicine. In particular, three domains of applications are reviewed: drug development, disease characteristic identification, and therapeutic effect prediction. The main objective of this review is to consider the applied methods in detail and to offer insights into their pros and cons. Although having demonstrated advantages in coping with data complexity and nonlinearity and in recognizing features and associating structural data, the studied learning methods are not a panacea to all medical problems.

	doi = {10.1186/s12911-019-0991-9},
	abstract = {Background: Identifying dementia early in time, using real world data, is a public health challenge. As only two-Thirds of people with dementia now ultimately receive a formal diagnosis in United Kingdom health systems and many receive it late in the disease process, there is ample room for improvement. The policy of the UK government and National Health Service (NHS) is to increase rates of timely dementia diagnosis. We used data from general practice (GP) patient records to create a machine-learning model to identify patients who have or who are developing dementia, but are currently undetected as having the condition by the GP. Methods: We used electronic patient records from Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD). Using a case-control design, we selected patients aged {\textgreater}65y with a diagnosis of dementia (cases) and matched them 1:1 by sex and age to patients with no evidence of dementia (controls). We developed a list of 70 clinical entities related to the onset of dementia and recorded in the 5 years before diagnosis. After creating binary features, we trialled machine learning classifiers to discriminate between cases and controls (logistic regression, naïve Bayes, support vector machines, random forest and neural networks). We examined the most important features contributing to discrimination. Results: The final analysis included data on 93,120 patients, with a median age of 82.6 years; 64.8\% were female. The naïve Bayes model performed least well. The logistic regression, support vector machine, neural network and random forest performed very similarly with an AUROC of 0.74. The top features retained in the logistic regression model were disorientation and wandering, behaviour change, schizophrenia, self-neglect, and difficulty managing. Conclusions: Our model could aid GPs or health service planners with the early detection of dementia. Future work could improve the model by exploring the longitudinal nature of patient data and modelling decline in function over time.},

	abstract = {Background: Data-driven population segmentation analysis utilizes data analytics to divide a heterogeneous population into parsimonious and relatively homogenous groups with similar healthcare characteristics. It is a promising patient-centric analysis that enables effective integrated healthcare interventions specific for each segment. Although widely applied, there is no systematic review on the clinical application of data-driven population segmentation analysis. Methods: We carried out a systematic literature search using PubMed, Embase and Web of Science following PRISMA criteria. We included English peer-reviewed articles that applied data-driven population segmentation analysis on empirical health data. We summarized the clinical settings in which segmentation analysis was applied, compared and contrasted strengths, limitations, and practical considerations of different segmentation methods, and assessed the segmentation outcome of all included studies. The studies were assessed by two independent reviewers. Results: We retrieved 14,514 articles and included 216 articles. Data-driven population segmentation analysis was widely used in different clinical contexts. 163 studies examined the general population while 53 focused on specific population with certain diseases or conditions, including psychological, oncological, respiratory, cardiovascular, and gastrointestinal conditions. Variables used for segmentation in the studies are heterogeneous. Most studies (n = 170) utilized secondary data in community settings (n = 185). The most common segmentation method was latent class/profile/transition/growth analysis (n = 96) followed by K-means cluster analysis (n = 60) and hierarchical analysis (n = 50), each having its advantages, disadvantages, and practical considerations. We also identified key criteria to evaluate a segmentation framework: internal validity, external validity, identifiability/interpretability, substantiality, stability, actionability/accessibility, and parsimony. Conclusions: Data-driven population segmentation has been widely applied and holds great potential in managing population health. The evaluations of segmentation outcome require the interplay of data analytics and subject matter expertise. The optimal framework for segmentation requires further research.},

	abstract = {Cancer has been characterized as a heterogeneous disease consisting of many different subtypes. The early diagnosis and prognosis of a cancer type have become a necessity in cancer research, as it can facilitate the subsequent clinical management of patients. The importance of classifying cancer patients into high or low risk groups has led many research teams, from the biomedical and the bioinformatics field, to study the application of machine learning (ML) methods. Therefore, these techniques have been utilized as an aim to model the progression and treatment of cancerous conditions. In addition, the ability of ML tools to detect key features from complex datasets reveals their importance. A variety of these techniques, including Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), Bayesian Networks (BNs), Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and Decision Trees (DTs) have been widely applied in cancer research for the development of predictive models, resulting in effective and accurate decision making. Even though it is evident that the use of ML methods can improve our understanding of cancer progression, an appropriate level of validation is needed in order for these methods to be considered in the everyday clinical practice. In this work, we present a review of recent ML approaches employed in the modeling of cancer progression. The predictive models discussed here are based on various supervised ML techniques as well as on different input features and data samples. Given the growing trend on the application of ML methods in cancer research, we present here the most recent publications that employ these techniques as an aim to model cancer risk or patient outcomes.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Despite vaccines and improved medical intensive care, clinicians must continue to be vigilant of possible Meningococcal Disease in children. The objective was to establish if the procalcitonin test was a cost-effective adjunct for prodromal Meningococcal Disease in children presenting at emergency department with fever without source. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Data to evaluate procalcitonin, C-reactive protein and white cell count tests as indicators of Meningococcal Disease were collected from six independent studies identified through a systematic literature search, applying PRISMA guidelines. The data included 881 children with fever without source in developed countries.The optimal cut-off value for the procalcitonin, C-reactive protein and white cell count tests, each as an indicator of Meningococcal Disease, was determined. Summary Receiver Operator Curve analysis determined the overall diagnostic performance of each test with 95\% confidence intervals. A decision analytic model was designed to reflect realistic clinical pathways for a child presenting with fever without source by comparing two diagnostic strategies: standard testing using combined C-reactive protein and white cell count tests compared to standard testing plus procalcitonin test. The costs of each of the four diagnosis groups (true positive, false negative, true negative and false positive) were assessed from a National Health Service payer perspective. The procalcitonin test was more accurate (sensitivity=0.89, 95\%CI=0.76-0.96; specificity=0.74, 95\%CI=0.4-0.92) for early Meningococcal Disease compared to standard testing alone (sensitivity=0.47, 95\%CI=0.32-0.62; specificity=0.8, 95\% CI=0.64-0.9). Decision analytic model outcomes indicated that the incremental cost effectiveness ratio for the base case was pound-8,137.25 (US \$ -13,371.94) per correctly treated patient. CONCLUSIONS: Procalcitonin plus standard recommended tests, improved the discriminatory ability for fatal Meningococcal Disease and was more cost-effective; it was also a superior biomarker in infants. Further research is recommended for point-of-care procalcitonin testing and Markov modelling to incorporate cost per QALY with a life-time model.},

	abstract = {With the rapid development of computer software and hardware technologies, more and more healthcare data are becoming readily available from clinical institutions, patients, insurance companies and pharmaceutical industries, among others. This access provides an unprecedented opportunity for data science technologies to derive data-driven insights and improve the quality of care delivery. Healthcare data, however, are usually fragmented and private making it difficult to generate robust results across populations. For example, different hospitals own the electronic health records (EHR) of different patient populations and these records are difficult to share across hospitals because of their sensitive nature. This creates a big barrier for developing effective analytical approaches that are generalizable, which need diverse, "big data". Federated learning, a mechanism of training a shared global model with a central server while keeping all the sensitive data in local institutions where the data belong, provides great promise to connect the fragmented healthcare data sources with privacy-preservation. The goal of this survey is to provide a review for federated learning technologies, particularly within the biomedical space. In particular, we summarize the general solutions to the statistical challenges, system challenges and privacy issues in federated learning, and point out the implications and potentials in healthcare.},

	abstract = {Deep learning based on artificial neural networks is a very popular approach to modeling, classifying, and recognizing complex data such as images, speech, and text. The unprecedented accuracy of deep learning methods has turned them into the foundation of new AI-based services on the Internet. Commercial companies that collect user data on a large scale have been the main beneficiaries of this trend since the success of deep learning techniques is directly proportional to the amount of data available for training. Massive data collection required for deep learning presents obvious privacy issues. Users' personal, highly sensitive data such as photos and voice recordings is kept indefinitely by the companies that collect it. Users can neither delete it, nor restrict the purposes for which it is used. Furthermore, centrally kept data is subject to legal subpoenas and extra-judicial surveillance. Many data owners--for example, medical institutions that may want to apply deep learning methods to clinical records--are prevented by privacy and confidentiality concerns from sharing the data and thus benefitting from large-scale deep learning. In this paper, we design, implement, and evaluate a practical system that enables multiple parties to jointly learn an accurate neural-network model for a given objective without sharing their input datasets. We exploit the fact that the optimization algorithms used in modern deep learning, namely, those based on stochastic gradient descent, can be parallelized and executed asynchronously. Our system lets participants train independently on their own datasets and selectively share small subsets of their models' key parameters during training. This offers an attractive point in the utility/privacy tradeoff space: participants preserve the privacy of their respective data while still benefitting from other participants' models and thus boosting their learning accuracy beyond what is achievable solely on their own inputs. We demonstrate the accuracy of our privacy-preserving deep learning on benchmark datasets.},

	abstract = {Federated Learning is a machine learning setting where the goal is to train a high-quality centralized model while training data remains distributed over a large number of clients each with unreliable and relatively slow network connections. We consider learning algorithms for this setting where on each round, each client independently computes an update to the current model based on its local data, and communicates this update to a central server, where the client-side updates are aggregated to compute a new global model. The typical clients in this setting are mobile phones, and communication efficiency is of the utmost importance. In this paper, we propose two ways to reduce the uplink communication costs: structured updates, where we directly learn an update from a restricted space parametrized using a smaller number of variables, e.g. either low-rank or a random mask; and sketched updates, where we learn a full model update and then compress it using a combination of quantization, random rotations, and subsampling before sending it to the server. Experiments on both convolutional and recurrent networks show that the proposed methods can reduce the communication cost by two orders of magnitude.},

	abstract = {In recent years, electronic health records (EHRs) have been widely adapted at many healthcare facilities in an attempt to improve the quality of patient care and increase the productivity and efficiency of healthcare delivery. These EHRs can accurately diagnose diseases if utilized appropriately. While the EHRs can potentially resolve many of the existing problems associated with disease diagnosis, one of the main obstacles in effectively using them is the patient privacy and sensitivity of the medical information available in the EHR. Due to these concerns, even if the EHRs are available for storage and retrieval purposes, sharing of the patient records between different healthcare facilities has become a major concern and has hampered some of the effective advantages of using EHRs. Due to this lack of data sharing, most of the facilities aim at building clinical decision support systems using limited amount of patient data from their own EHR systems to provide important diagnosis related decisions. It becomes quite infeasible for a newly established healthcare facility to build a robust decision making system due to the lack of sufficient patient records. However, to make effective decisions from clinical data, it is indispensable to have large amounts of data to train the decision models. In this regard, there are conflicting objectives of preserving patient privacy and having sufficient data for modeling and decision making. To handle such disparate goals, we develop two adaptive distributed privacy-preserving algorithms based on a distributed ensemble strategy. The basic idea of our approach is to build an elegant model for each participating facility to accurately learn the data distribution, and then can transfer the useful healthcare knowledge acquired on their data from these participators in the form of their own decision models without revealing and sharing the patient-level sensitive data, thus protecting patient privacy. We demonstrate that our approach can successfully build accurate and robust prediction models, under privacy constraints, using the healthcare data collected from different geographical locations. We demonstrate the performance of our method using the Type-2 diabetes EHRs accumulated from multiple sources from all fifty states in the U.S. Our method was evaluated on diagnosing diabetes in the presence of insufficient number of patient records from certain regions without revealing the actual patient data from other regions. Using the proposed approach, we also discovered the important biomarkers, both universal and region-specific, and validated the selected biomarkers using the biomedical literature.},

	abstract = {Objective: Deep learning has become a promising approach for automated support for clinical diagnosis. When medical data samples are limited, collaboration among multiple institutions is necessary to achieve high algorithm performance. However, sharing patient data often has limitations due to technical, legal, or ethical concerns. In this study, we propose methods of distributing deep learning models as an attractive alternative to sharing patient data.
Methods: We simulate the distribution of deep learning models across 4 institutions using various training heuristics and compare the results with a deep learning model trained on centrally hosted patient data. The training heuristics investigated include ensembling single institution models, single weight transfer, and cyclical weight transfer. We evaluated these approaches for image classification in 3 independent image collections (retinal fundus photos, mammography, and ImageNet).
Results: We find that cyclical weight transfer resulted in a performance that was comparable to that of centrally hosted patient data. We also found that there is an improvement in the performance of cyclical weight transfer heuristic with a high frequency of weight transfer.
Conclusions: We show that distributing deep learning models is an effective alternative to sharing patient data. This finding has implications for any collaborative deep learning study.},

        , Machine learning applications for personalized medicine are highly dependent on access to sufficient data. For personalized radiation oncology, datasets representing the variation in the entire cancer patient population need to be acquired and used to learn prediction models. Ethical and legal boundaries to ensure data privacy hamper collaboration between research institutes. We hypothesize that data sharing is possible without identifiable patient data leaving the radiation clinics and that building machine learning applications on distributed datasets is feasible., We developed and implemented an IT infrastructure in five radiation clinics across three countries (Belgium, Germany, and The Netherlands). We present here a proof-of-principle for future ‘big data’ infrastructures and distributed learning studies. Lung cancer patient data was collected in all five locations and stored in local databases. Exemplary support vector machine (SVM) models were learned using the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) from the distributed databases to predict post-radiotherapy dyspnea grade ⩾2. The discriminative performance was assessed by the area under the curve (AUC) in a five-fold cross-validation (learning on four sites and validating on the fifth). The performance of the distributed learning algorithm was compared to centralized learning where datasets of all institutes are jointly analyzed., The euroCAT infrastructure has been successfully implemented in five radiation clinics across three countries. SVM models can be learned on data distributed over all five clinics. Furthermore, the infrastructure provides a general framework to execute learning algorithms on distributed data. The ongoing expansion of the euroCAT network will facilitate machine learning in radiation oncology. The resulting access to larger datasets with sufficient variation will pave the way for generalizable prediction models and personalized medicine.},

  abstract = {With the rapid development of computer software and hardware technologies, more and more healthcare data are becoming readily available from clinical institutions, patients, insurance companies, and pharmaceutical industries, among others. This access provides an unprecedented opportunity for data science technologies to derive data-driven insights and improve the quality of care delivery. Healthcare data, however, are usually fragmented and private making it difficult to generate robust results across populations. For example, different hospitals own the electronic health records (EHR) of different patient populations and these records are difficult to share across hospitals because of their sensitive nature. This creates a big barrier for developing effective analytical approaches that are generalizable, which need diverse, “big data.” Federated learning, a mechanism of training a shared global model with a central server while keeping all the sensitive data in local institutions where the data belong, provides great promise to connect the fragmented healthcare data sources with privacy-preservation. The goal of this survey is to provide a review for federated learning technologies, particularly within the biomedical space. In particular, we summarize the general solutions to the statistical challenges, system challenges, and privacy issues in federated learning, and point out the implications and potentials in healthcare.},

The enhancement in information and communications technology (ICT) has indisputably improved the quality of people's lives around the globe. Especially, ICT has led to a very needy and tremendous improvement in the health sector which is commonly known as electronic health (eHealth) and medical health (mHealth). Deep machine learning and AI approaches are commonly presented in many applications using big data, which consists of all relevant data about the medical health and diseases which a model can access at the time of execution or diagnosis of diseases. For example, cardiovascular imaging has now accurate imaging combined with big data from the eHealth record and pathology to better characterize the disease and personalized therapy. In clinical work and imaging, cancer care is getting improved by knowing the tumor biology and helping in the implementation of precision medicine. The Markov model is used to extract new approaches for leveraging cancer. In this paper, we have reviewed existing research relevant to eHealth and mHealth where various models are discussed which uses big data for the diagnosis and healthcare system. This paper summarizes the recent promising applications of AI and big data in medical health and electronic health, which have potentially added value to diagnosis and patient care.},

The increase in computer hardware and software applications in medicine, as well as digitization of health-related data together fuel progress in the development and use of AI in medicine. This progress provides new opportunities and challenges, as well as directions for the future of AI in health. OBJECTIVE: The goals of this survey are to review the current state of AI in health, along with opportunities, challenges, and practical implications. This review highlights recent developments over the past five years and directions for the future. METHODS: Publications over the past five years reporting the use of AI in health in clinical and biomedical informatics journals, as well as computer science conferences, were selected according to Google Scholar citations. Publications were then categorized into five different classes, according to the type of data analyzed. RESULTS: The major data types identified were multi-omics, clinical, behavioral, environmental and pharmaceutical research and development (R\&D) data. The current state of AI related to each data type is described, followed by associated challenges and practical implications that have emerged over the last several years. Opportunities and future directions based on these advances are discussed. CONCLUSION: Technologies have enabled the development of AI-assisted approaches to healthcare. However, there remain challenges. Work is currently underway to address multi-modal data integration, balancing quantitative algorithm performance and qualitative model interpretability, protection of model security, federated learning, and model bias.},

Driven by privacy concerns and the visions of deep learning, the last four years have witnessed a paradigm shift in the applicability mechanism of machine learning (ML). An emerging model, called federated learning (FL), is rising above both centralized systems and on-site analysis, to be a new fashioned design for ML implementation. It is a privacy-preserving decentralized approach, which keeps raw data on devices and involves local ML training while eliminating data communication overhead. A federation of the learned and shared models is then performed on a central server to aggregate and share the built knowledge among participants. This article starts by examining and comparing different ML-based deployment architectures, followed by in-depth and in-breadth investigation on FL. Compared to the existing reviews in the field, we provide in this survey a new classification of FL topics and research fields based on thorough analysis of the main technical challenges and current related work. In this context, we elaborate comprehensive taxonomies covering various challenging aspects, contributions, and trends in the literature, including core system models and designs, application areas, privacy and security, and resource management. Furthermore, we discuss important challenges and open research directions toward more robust FL systems.},

  abstract = {Today, the rapid growth of the internet and advancements in mobile technology and increased internet connectivity have brought us to a data-driven economy where an enormous amount of data is being used to train machine learning models to make strategic decisions. However, in the aftermath of a data breach by Facebook in 2018, there are some serious concerns over user data privacy and security being used to train the Machine Learning models. In this context, a new approach, Federated Machine Learning is now one of the most talked-about and recent approaches. Current research primarily focuses on Federated Learning's advantages over the traditional methods and/or its classification. However, being in a nascent stage of development as a method, certain challenges need to be addressed. This paper intends to address the totality of federated learning with a complete vulnerability assessment. During the study of the literature, it is found that security being promised as one of the key advantages of federated learning can still not be guaranteed because of some issues inherently present, and this can lead to poisoning, inference attacks and insertion of backdoors, etc. This paper intends to provide a complete picture by giving an in-depth and comprehensive analysis of Federated Learning and its taxonomy. It also provides a detailed vulnerability assessment and highlights the challenges faced in the current setting and future research directions to make federated learning a more functional, robust and secure method to train machine learning models.},

We provide definitions, architectures, and applications for the federated-learning framework, and provide a comprehensive survey of existing works on this subject.

  abstract = {This paper systematically reviews and objectively analyzes the approaches to improving the quality of Federated Learning models, and proposes an FL application framework for practitioners. As an emerging technique, Federated Learning (FL) can jointly train a global model with the data remaining locally, which effectively solves the problem of data privacy protection through the encryption mechanism. The clients train their local model, and the server aggregates models until convergence. In this process, the server uses an incentive mechanism to encourage clients to contribute high-quality and large-volume data to improve the global model. Although some works have applied FL to the Internet of Things (IoT), medicine, manufacturing, etc., the application of FL is still in its infancy, and many related issues need to be solved. Improving the quality of FL models is one of the current research hotspots and challenging tasks. This paper systematically reviews and objectively analyzes the approaches to improving the quality of FL models. We are also interested in the research and application trends of FL and the effect comparison between FL and non-FL because the practitioners usually worry that achieving privacy protection needs compromising learning quality. We use a systematic review method to analyze 147 latest articles related to FL. This review provides useful information and insights to both academia and practitioners from the industry. We investigate research questions about academic research and industrial application trends of FL, essential factors affecting the quality of FL models, and compare FL and non-FL algorithms in terms of learning quality. Based on our review's conclusion, we give some suggestions for improving the FL model quality. Finally, we propose an FL application framework for practitioners.},

Modern mobile devices have access to a wealth of data suitable for learning models, which in turn can greatly improve the user experience on the device. For example, language models can improve speech recognition and text entry, and image models can automatically select good photos. However, this rich data is often privacy sensitive, large in quantity, or both, which may preclude logging to the data-center and training there using conventional approaches. We advocate an alternative that leaves the training data distributed on the mobile devices, and learns a shared model by aggregating locally-computed updates. We term this decentralized approach Federated Learning.  We present a practical method for the federated learning of deep networks that proves robust to the unbalanced and non-IID data distributions that naturally arise. This method allows high-quality models to be trained in relatively few rounds of communication, the principal constraint for federated learning. The key insight is that despite the non-convex loss functions we optimize, parameter averaging over updates from multiple clients produces surprisingly good results, for example decreasing the communication needed to train an LSTM language model by two orders of magnitude.},

  abstract = {Federated learning has been a hot research topic in enabling the collaborative training of machine learning models among different organizations under the privacy restrictions. As researchers try to support more machine learning models with different privacy-preserving approaches, there is a requirement in developing systems and infrastructures to ease the development of various federated learning algorithms. Similar to deep learning systems such as PyTorch and TensorFlow that boost the development of deep learning, federated learning systems (FLSs) are equivalently important, and face challenges from various aspects such as effectiveness, efficiency, and privacy. In this survey, we conduct a comprehensive review on federated learning systems. To achieve smooth flow and guide future research, we introduce the definition of federated learning systems and analyze the system components. Moreover, we provide a thorough categorization for federated learning systems according to six different aspects, including data distribution, machine learning model, privacy mechanism, communication architecture, scale of federation and motivation of federation. The categorization can help the design of federated learning systems as shown in our case studies. By systematically summarizing the existing federated learning systems, we present the design factors, case studies, and future research opportunities.},

However, data centralization for big data raises privacy and regulatory concerns.             Covered topics include (1) an introduction to privacy of patient data and distributed learning as a potential solution to preserving these data, a description of the legal context for patient data research, and a definition of machine/deep learning concepts; (2) a presentation of the adopted review protocol; (3) a presentation of the search results; and (4) a discussion of the findings, limitations of the review, and future perspectives.             Distributed learning from federated databases makes data centralization unnecessary. Distributed algorithms iteratively analyze separate databases, essentially sharing research questions and answers between databases instead of sharing the data. In other words, one can learn from separate and isolated datasets without patient data ever leaving the individual clinical institutes.             Distributed learning promises great potential to facilitate big data for medical application, in particular for international consortiums.

  abstract = {Heterogeneous tabular data are the most commonly used form of data and are essential for numerous critical and computationally demanding applications. On homogeneous data sets, deep neural networks have repeatedly shown excellent performance and have therefore been widely adopted. However, their adaptation to tabular data for inference or data generation tasks remains challenging. To facilitate further progress in the field, this work provides an overview of state-of-the-art deep learning methods for tabular data. We categorize these methods into three groups: data transformations, specialized architectures, and regularization models. For each of these groups, our work offers a comprehensive overview of the main approaches. Moreover, we discuss deep learning approaches for generating tabular data, and we also provide an overview over strategies for explaining deep models on tabular data. Thus, our first contribution is to address the main research streams and existing methodologies in the mentioned areas, while highlighting relevant challenges and open research questions. Our second contribution is to provide an empirical comparison of traditional machine learning methods with eleven deep learning approaches across five popular real-world tabular data sets of different sizes and with different learning objectives. Our results, which we have made publicly available as competitive benchmarks, indicate that algorithms based on gradient-boosted tree ensembles still mostly outperform deep learning models on supervised learning tasks, suggesting that the research progress on competitive deep learning models for tabular data is stagnating. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first in-depth overview of deep learning approaches for tabular data; as such, this work can serve as a valuable starting point to guide researchers and practitioners interested in deep learning with tabular data.},

  abstract = {While deep learning has enabled tremendous progress on text and image datasets, its superiority on tabular data is not clear. We contribute extensive benchmarks of standard and novel deep learning methods as well as tree-based models such as XGBoost and Random Forests, across a large number of datasets and hyperparameter combinations. We define a standard set of 45 datasets from varied domains with clear characteristics of tabular data and a benchmarking methodology accounting for both fitting models and finding good hyperparameters. Results show that tree-based models remain state-of-the-art on medium-sized data (\$\textbackslash sim\$10K samples) even without accounting for their superior speed. To understand this gap, we conduct an empirical investigation into the differing inductive biases of tree-based models and Neural Networks (NNs). This leads to a series of challenges which should guide researchers aiming to build tabular-specific NNs: 1. be robust to uninformative features, 2. preserve the orientation of the data, and 3. be able to easily learn irregular functions. To stimulate research on tabular architectures, we contribute a standard benchmark and raw data for baselines: every point of a 20 000 compute hours hyperparameter search for each learner.},
