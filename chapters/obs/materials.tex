Data was collected from nine different public Portuguese hospitals across the country, focusing on obstetric information, encompassing maternal data, various fetal data points, and the method of delivery in a retrospective manner. The data is from all patients that had information registered in the obstetrics EHR and had a registered outcome of the pregnancy from 2019 to 2020. Despite differing software versions across hospitals, each institution used identical EHR software, ensuring the columns remained consistent.
