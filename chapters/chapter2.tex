The most exciting phrase to hear in science, the one that heralds new discoveries, is not 'Eureka!' but 'That's funny...'

\chapter{State of the art} \label{chap:sota}


In this chapter, we cover some fundamental concepts and connections between some of the most important fields of study that are relevant to this thesis. We will start by covering the basics of \ac{ai} and its history and how it came to be the powerhouse and almost generic term that it is today. Then we will follow up to \ac{ebm} and its importance to modern medicine, some barriers and benefits of following such practice and paradigm. Thirdly, we will focus on \ac{kdd} and how healthcare databases can provide support for new knowledge.

Then we will cover the field of \ac{heads} and its connections to \ac{ai}, \ac{ebm} and \ac{kdd} as a way of bringing all of these together. We will then cover the field of \ac{xai} and its connections and \ac{cml} and how these subfields are vital to tackle modern medicine and a cornerstone of building trust in computerized systems and autonomous decision support tools. We conclude this chapter by covering some legal and ethical considerations relevant to this thesis.
