With the wide spreading of healthcare information systems across all contexts of healthcare practice, the production of health-related data has followed this incremental behaviour. The potential for using this data to create new clinical knowledge and push medicine further is tempting \cite{martin-sanchezBigDataMedicine2014}.
However, to correctly use the data stored in \acp{ehr}, the quality of the data must be robust enough to sustain the clinical decisions made based on this data. Data quality cannot be understood as a straightforward concept; it is highly dependent on the context in which it is evaluated. The quality thresholds and dimensions required to classify the quality of the data depend on the purpose that we intend to use that very same data \cite{waljiElectronicHealthRecords2019}. These uses can be very distinct and have different impacts as well. For one, we can use data to support day-to-day decisions regarding individual patients' care \cite{verheijPossibleSourcesBias2018}. These decisions can include ones based on recorded information to understand a patient's history, clinical decision support systems based on this data, or even using the data to help support a more macro, public health-oriented decision. Another area is using information for management purposes. The data can be used by management bodies and regulatory authorities to extract metrics regarding the quality of care or reimbursement purposes. Thirdly, data can be used for research purposes, namely observational studies and, more recently, to support clinical trials through real-world evidence analysis \cite{coreyAssessingQualitySurgical2020,verheijPossibleSourcesBias2018,wengClinicalDataQuality2020}. 
So, all the \ac{ehr} data-based decisions can only be as good as the data supporting them. Several studies have already warned about the lack of data quality in \acp{ehr} and how this can be a significant hurdle to an accurate representation of the population and potentially lead to erroneous healthcare decisions \cite{reimerDataQualityAssessment2016a,joukesImpactElectronicPaperBased2019a,huserMultisiteEvaluationData2016,zhangUnderstandingDetectingDefects2020,kramerImpactDataQuality2021,gigantiImpactDataQuality2019}.

There are several steps in the data lifecycle that can be prone to error, from data generation, where the data is registered by healthcare professionals, passing by data processing, whether inside healthcare institutions or by software engineers aiming to reuse data, to data interpretation and reuse, where investigators try to interpret the meaning of registered data \cite{wengClinicalDataQuality2020}.
So, with all the data's possible uses added to the several steps that can introduce errors throughout the data lifecycle, data quality frameworks and sequential implementations can have very distinct approaches and methodologies to assess data quality. Data quality tools for checking data being registered live to support day-to-day decisions will be significantly different from one whose only purpose is to provide quality checks for research purposes. So, methodologies to tackle these issues are necessary for guaranteeing the quality of healthcare practice and the knowledge derived from \ac{ehr} data.
