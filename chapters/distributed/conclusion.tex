With this paper, it was possible to assess how well-distributed models can perform with real data, when compared to local models (trained with data from each silo) and global centralised models (trained with all data). These results show that an ensemble of models is able to fully grasp the specificity of the data, with performance similar to that of a model built with all the data. Even though the nature of the target and the silos can impact the performance, and several issues should be considered during the implementation phase, we are now fairly confident that distributed learning is a step forward regarding data privacy without loss of prediction performance.
Finally, taken into account that the scores for several target variables are \ac{auroc}/\ac{auprc} above 80\% and \ac{mae} below 1, we will explore this further in a different work. We hope to be able to develop distributed models for predicting clinical outcomes like delivery type or Robson group, that could turn out useful in real-world clinical practice.
