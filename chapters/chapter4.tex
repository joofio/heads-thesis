\chapter{Case Studies}\label{chap:usecase}
This chapter will comprise the work done during this PhD. The works developed and corresponding papers were a search for improving data usage in several steps of the \ac{kdd} process. We can see some work dedicated to leveraging data acquisition or alternatives to it, like the works depicted in section \ref{subsec:distributed}, \ref{subsec:benchmark}, \ref{subsec:similarity}, \ref{subsec:tabular} and \ref{subsec:gans}. Other will focus more on how to use the data in order to make a difference in clinical practice like the section \ref{subsec:ipop}, \ref{subsec:obs} and \ref{subsec:dq}.



\section{Can GANs help create realistic datasets?}\label{subsec:gans}
This section is based on the paper entitled "GANs for Tabular Healthcare Data Generation: A Review on Utility and Privacy". It focus on a review of the \ac{gan} framework for creating synthetic data for healthcare. Tries to compile the metrics used for comparing and assessing synthetic data in terms of utility - or how similar they are to the original data and privacy - how proctetive of the patient's data it is.

\section{Pulling the current metrics of assessing datasets}\label{subsec:tabular}
This section is based on the paper entitled "Dataset Comparison Tool: Utility and Privacy". This work followed the work on section \ref{subsec:gans}, where we compiled ways of assessing the utility of synthetic data. We understood that the mechanisms were far from consensual and a tool could be of use to merge all of this into a single file and report about data. Our purpose was to facilitate health data owners and legal responsible to understand how similar and protective a dataset was regarding the original one.

\section{Leveraging data to assess treatment efficacy}\label{subsec:ipop}
This section is based on the paper entitled "so and so"

\section{Leveraging data to create Clinical Decision Support Systems}\label{subsec:obs}
This section is based on the paper entitled "Machine-learning in Obstetrics: FHIR-based Support System for predicting delivery type". This work was in part a result of the work in section \ref{subsec:distributed}. While testing for distributed mechanisms, we kind of felt that some of the evaluation metrics were inspiring to pursue this further. We built a \ac{cdss} system that is interoperable and aims to provide support for subpar evaluation of a \ac{cs}.
