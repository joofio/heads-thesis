Comparing two tabular datasets has been growing in demand in the past year mainly because of the increase in popularity of tabular data synthesis methods which have exhibited the potential in generating valuable synthetic data. However, due to the absence of a uniform metric, evaluating different methods has been inconsistent. This research proposes some alternatives for assessing synthetic tabular data's utility. \ac{rbo} seems to have the potential to capture inter-column relationships in a more consistent way than cross-classification. They could become a useful tool for comparing statistical methods of generating synthetic tabular data. Furthermore, this metric can aid in evaluating these generators' training, providing insights into improving synthetic data quality. The proposed metrics open up possibilities for future research to enhance tabular data synthesis methods and compare two datasets overall. Future research could be expanded in new comparison with others evaluation metrics, other datasets and other synthetic data generators.
