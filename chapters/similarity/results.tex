With the method described in the algorithm \ref{alg:simil_1}, we created a figure where the metrics are presented with increasingly different datasets: Figure \ref{fig:lineplot}.
%Then we compared the difference in the metric across iterations, rendering figure \ref{fig:boxplot}.

\caption[Plot showing the variation of different metrics over increasingly changed datasets.]{Plot showing the decrease of the metric over increasingly changed datasets. The X axis represents the number of columns mutated. The Y axis represents the value of the metric and the hue represents the algorithm used to calculate the metric.}\label{fig:lineplot}

The number of repetitions and how that impacts the variance of the scores is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:facet_plot}.

    \caption{Heatmap showing the variance of different repetitions for every metric and the number of different columns changed. X is the metric. Y is the number of repetitions and the number of columns. This was obtained by getting the variance of all values from all datasets.  }\label{fig:facet_plot}

As for the test for the synthetic and real dataset, the results are displayed in figure~\ref{fig:synth_result} and ~\ref{fig:synth_heat}. This is the metrics distribution for the comparison of the 5 mentioned datasets and the synthetic counterpart generated as stated in the methods section.
