We used 5 datasets from the \ac{uci} repository. The ones chosen were related to healthcare and were heart disease \cite{misc_heart_disease_45}, thyroid disease \cite{misc_thyroid_disease_102}, liver disorders \cite{misc_liver_disorders_60}, breast cancer \cite{misc_breast_cancer_wisconsin_diagnostic_17} and the primary tumour dataset \cite{misc_primary_tumor_83}. We made minimal preprocessing on the datasets, namely removing the missing variables by imputing the mean on continuous variables and mode on categorical.
We also created a synthetic dataset by applying the \textit{synthpop} package to this data \cite{synthpop}. With this package, all variables were synthesised using the "cart" method, which is rpart implementation of a CART model.
