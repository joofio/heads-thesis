We used 5 datasets from the UCI dataset repository. The ones chosen were related to healthcare and were heart disease \cite{misc_heart_disease_45}, thyroid disease \cite{misc_thyroid_disease_102}, liver disorders \cite{misc_liver_disorders_60}, breast cancer \cite{misc_breast_cancer_wisconsin_diagnostic_17} and the primary tumour dataset \cite{misc_primary_tumor_83}. These datasets were chosen due to three main reasons: 1) being open and facilitating recreation of results; 2) being tabular with mixed datatypes to better represent data in the real world and 3) diversity across domains inside healthcare (different diseases and contexts).

We made minimal preprocessing on the datasets, namely removing the missing variables by imputing the mean on continuous variables and mode on categorical.
We also created several synthetic datasets by applying known methods. Descriptive statistics of the datasets used are shown in table \ref{tab:descrptive_feature}.
