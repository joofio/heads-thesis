\section{Rationale}
Healthcare practice revolves a lot around technology. Technology in the definitional sense of referring to \textit{" methods, systems, and devices which are the result of scientific knowledge being used for practical purposes"}. Healthcare and medicine are in fact applied sciences where we use our knowledge of biology, physics, chemistry, and math and apply those concepts in order to create treatments, diagnoses, procedures, etc.
However, in the last 20-30 years, computer science and informatics started gaining traction in the healthcare space \cite{adler-milsteinHITECHActDrove2017}. A paper-based industry is now being digitalized and computerized. This has been leading to an increase in the amount of data generated by healthcare systems \cite{kruseUseElectronicHealth2018,palabindalaAdoptionElectronicHealth2016}. 
This data has the potential to greatly improve the current methods and practices in healthcare. However, it is still not being used to its full potential \cite{kruseUseElectronicHealth2018}. This is especially important when we note that the gold standard of evidence creation is \acp{rct} which can vary on quality, time, and resources. A \ac{rct} may cost no less than 20 million euros to run, and according to a report submitted to the \ac{us} Department of Health and Human Services \cite{sertkayaaylinEXAMINATIONCLINICALTRIAL2014} can cost as much as 100 million \ac{us} dollars. This is indeed a very steep price to get the information we need to innovate. Parallel to this, usually supported by these \acp{rct} are systematic reviews and meta-analyses, highly supported and promoted by \ac{ebm} which are estimated to cost around 140 thousand dollars each \cite{michelsonSignificantCostSystematic2019}. Additionally, we have to take into account the time that it takes to create and publish a good paper on evidence synthesis, often making it hard to keep up with the pace of innovation.

So, we are now being faced with huge amounts of clinical data generated by \acp{ehr} and \acp{his}. But which tools are the most suited for harvesting the potential of this data? 
The capabilities and assumptions behind modern \ac{kdd}, \ac{ml} and \ac{ai} seem like a good approach for harvesting this potential. However, they are very different from the traditional statistical methods that are usually used in healthcare.
So, in order to properly use these methods in healthcare and actually provide value to the patients, we need to understand the differences between these methods and how they can be used to complement each other.

Currently, we already have an idea of what are the major key areas that hinder the adoption of \ac{ai} in healthcare like problems related to data privacy and security, data quality and integrity, interoperability, ethical considerations, and the fact that the hype of \ac{ai} is far greater than the \ac{ai} science, the acceptance, and trust of healthcare practitioners of \ac{ai} based systems   \cite{muhiyaddinImpactClinicalDecision2020,kilsdonkFactorsInfluencingImplementation2017}, and how to proper evaluate the potential risks of \ac{ai} in healthcare, just to mention a few \cite{topolHighperformanceMedicineConvergence2019a}.
This is a very complex problem that requires a lot of different approaches and solutions. It is a popular assumption that 87\% of data science projects never get into production \cite{Why87Data2019}. Even if numbers for the healthcare domain at not available at this time, it is safe to assume that the number is not much different, if not higher.

So, with this introduction, we have there is still a long way to go to harvest all the potential healthcare data has to offer. And so my research objectives are focused on powering up this adoption. What can be done to improve these chances? What can we bring to the table to enhance the rate of success?

\section{Research Objectives}
%%rework
This thesis has three main goals:


\begin{itemize}
    \item Goal 1: Research methods for improving Data Quality. Whether through synthetic data generation to enlarge data volume and protect privacy (sections \ref{subsec:gans}, \ref{subsec:tabular} and \ref{subsec:similarity}) or by creating automatic data quality assessments  (section \ref{subsec:dq})

    \item Goal 2: Assess alternative ways of usage of data without having access to all of it. This will be covered in sections \ref{subsec:distributed} and \ref{subsec:benchmark}.

    \item Goal 3: Difficulties and steps resulting from attempts to convert data into decisions and policies, whether through \ac{ml} or traditional statistics. This will be covered in sections \ref{subsec:ipop} and \ref{subsec:obs}.
\end{itemize}
