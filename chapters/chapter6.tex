\section{Limitations of the Studies}

\section{Conclusion}
Leveraging healthcare data is not an easy task.

For this work to be complete, i had to gather knowledge from different areas. From biology and chemistry, for the healthcare part of it, process design to understand and formalize processes, and math and statistics for machine learning and \ac{eda}, interoperability and standards for getting data together, ethics and privacy to gather data with garantees to the patient's privacy and for creating ethical-aware models. Had to dwell into terminologies and healthcare codification and semantics to interpret data and also get acquainted with some clinical specialities like obstetrics and oncology. Had to collect evidence and make the bridge between \acp{rct} and observational data or \ac{rwd} so study design as also needed to bridge the gap.
Maybe this is on the main issues with this domain, where a different set of skills are required to do everything. The alternativa would be a team of different people.

\section{Recommendations for Future Research}

focus on impact and application in real world.
