\chapter{Identify Attempts to Convert Health Data into Decisions and Policies}\label{chap:goal3}
This chapter focuses on the practical application of health data in influencing decisions and policies, particularly in the realms of drug evaluation and obstetrics, as detailed in sections \ref{subsec:ipop} and \ref{subsec:obs}.

Section \ref{subsec:ipop} represents an innovative application of causality principles and transparent \ac{ml} models to assess the real-world effectiveness of two groups of breast cancer drugs. Beginning with traditional analysis methods, the study progressively adopts more complex techniques, including \ac{iptw} to enhance the comparative assessment of these treatments. This approach exemplifies how health data, analyzed through advanced methodologies, can influence drug policy and treatment choices in clinical settings.

Section \ref{subsec:obs} is an extension of research in distributed data mechanisms (referenced in section \ref{subsec:distributed}), uses machine learning to develop a \ac{cdss} designed to assist in evaluating \ac{cs}. The system's interoperability and its focus on supporting subpar evaluation of \ac{cs} demonstrate the utilization of health data in creating tools that aid in decision-making processes in obstetrics. This section underscores the importance of applying health data analytics in real-time clinical environments to inform decisions and shape obstetrical policies.



\section{How Can We Leverage Data to Assess Treatment Efficacy?}\label{subsec:ipop}
This section is based on the paper entitled "Comparative Analysis of Palbociclib and Ribociclib: A real world data and Propensity Score-Adjusted Evaluation with endocrine therapy". This was a method of applying the knowledge of causality and transparent \ac{ml} models in order to assess the real-world effect of two drugs for breast cancer. We started with traditional analysis and then moved to a more complex approach, using \ac{iptw} methods in order to further compare treatments.

    \section{How Can We Leverage Data To Create Clinical Decision Support Systems?}\label{subsec:obs}
    This section is based on the paper entitled "Machine-learning in Obstetrics: FHIR-based Support System for predicting delivery type". This work was in part a result of the work in section \ref{subsec:distributed}. While testing for distributed mechanisms, we kind of felt that some evaluation metrics were inspiring to pursue this further. We built a \ac{cdss} system that is interoperable and aims to provide support for subpar evaluation of a \ac{cs}.
